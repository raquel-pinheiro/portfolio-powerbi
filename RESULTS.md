## Report Insights

* This report shows that P06 is problematic in 2023 and 2024 and needs attention, mainly because Revenue is lower for all 3 scenarios while Operating Expenses remains high.

* Salaries and Standard Cost of Sales contribute to lower perfomance in P06 in both 2023 and 2024, meaning that OPEX and COGS must be adjusted for P06.

* P06 forecasting also shows low accuracy compared to all other accounting periods.
